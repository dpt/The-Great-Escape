<h3>DAY ONE</h3>
Collect the key from under the watchtower and open the door where the toolkit is found. Drop the key on the floor and pick up the toolkit. Open the door where the spade is found. Collect the torch and the papers and take them to the room where the spade is and drop them down the tunnel. Return to normal duties.

The compass should be in the red cross parcel. Take it to the room where the spade is and go down the tunnel. Pick up the torch and take the compass to the other end of the tunnel. Drop the compass and return for the wire cutters. Go back to where you dropped the compass and drop the torch. Pick up the compass and wait a few seconds. Now run up to the wire and cut it.
